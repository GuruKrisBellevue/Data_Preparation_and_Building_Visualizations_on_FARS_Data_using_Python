    "#### ***Overview of the Approach in this Project:*** \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. In this project, three csv files- Person, Race and Weather are read using pandas library and loaded as Dataframes. \n",
    "##### 2. The dataframes are then cleansed such as removing duplicates, treating Nulls, convering to upper case, remove spaces, etc.\n",
    "##### 3. Data in the three dataframes are then merged into a single dataframe using common keys. After each step, the resulting dataframe is cleansed .\n",
    "##### 4. New columns are then added to the merged dataframed and the fields that are not necessary are dropped.\n",
    "##### 5. The values in the columns of the merged dataframes are then Standardized by removing redundant categories and replacing them with general categories.\n",
    "##### 6. New dataframes are then created from the merged dataframe which will later be used for building Visualizations.\n"

For instance, some of the categories that had less than 100 occurances in the sample wer marked under the miscelleanous category. This was done for  the ease of visualization to avoid too many categories in the graph and also to avoid the loss of the data. Some of these may have ethical implications due to generalizing the data.\n",

This was done again for the ease of visualizations and to avoid too many details and sub categories. The Implication is that a person with 0.10% BAC and someone that was too drunk ( > 0.50 % BAC)will be classified in the same category.\n",
